# Depression

Site Link: WIP

Because the repo is private and GitHub doesn't like making private repos into pages unless I feed it cash. It's pretty sad.

## Progress
**Day 1 [23/05/2020]**
- I learned something new today and it makes me want to kms honestly

**Day 2 [24/05/2020]**
- Yay, I learned so much today that I might be able to actually start without a framework
