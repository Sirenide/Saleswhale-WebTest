# Depression

**Site Link:** http://uwuwu-site.herokuapp.com/

Because the repo is private and GitHub doesn't like making private repos into pages unless I feed it cash. It's pretty sad.

## Progress
**Day 1 [23/05/2020]**
- I learned something new today and it makes me want to kms honestly

**Day 2 [24/05/2020]**
- [AM] Yay, I learned so much today that I might be able to actually start without a framework

- [PM] Mobile view almost done except for the footer; code needs clean up and might as well start on the tablet/desktop ~~hell~~ layout tomorrow

**Day 3 [25/05/2020]**
- [AM] Finished mobile layout without foooter; probably gonna start on tablet later cuz this bitch makes me go crazy

## To Fix:

- Width problem on mobile
